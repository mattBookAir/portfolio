            In order to &quot;address division in America by promoting and
            fostering compassion, empathy and civil discourse using food&quot;,
            we needed a website to act as both a place to distribute what was
            intended to be a full library of marketing materials and content, as
            well as a repository to hold content generated by users at scale, to
            be buildable and manageable by three people on a very small budget.
          </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          The first thing we did, as a few people with little website
          experience, was to find and crawl through other websites that featured
          either designs we liked or which disseminated similar information to
          what we intended to share; after a brief wireframing phase, we delved
          right into building the site itself in WordPress, the framework with
          which the team had the most collective experience at the time, while
          working concurrently on branding the business.

      </div>
      <div id="orfuContent2">
        <p>
          We used the following technologies to build the site:
          <ul>
            <li>Adobe Creative Suite and Balsamiq for prototyping</li>
            <li>
              WordPress, with a custom theme and plugins including SiteOrigin
              page-builder, Ninjaforms, and WordPress-Donate.
            </li>
            <li>SiteGround backend, GoDaddy domain hosting</li>

            The development process started with my learning HTML and CSS through
            Freecodecamp. It was then out of the frying pan and into the fire; as we
            worked to realize our ambitious goals, we developed and staged on
            WordPress, and as we would have meetings and make decisions, I would
            bounce between the roles of administrator, graphic designer, copywriter
            and editor, and web designer/developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We conducted a very basic test of the website, where we invited around
            50 people to test a private version of the site and to provide feedback
            that we would incorporate prior to our August 2019 launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            I particularly enjoyed creating the dynamic sidebar, which, when you
            navigated to a new page on the website, would provide both a new quote
            and a Tweet from the ORfU account. I am also proud of a (now defunct)
            feature where stories/recipes added would be added to an interactive map
            showing the breadth of our users.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the site was up for only around two years (it is currently on
            hiatus, as the executive director returned to school), it garnered
            respectable attention, and the executive director plans to boot the site
            back up in the future.
