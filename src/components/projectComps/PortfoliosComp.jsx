        The very first incarnation of the site was a simple Tumblr site meant to
        serve as a portfolio/repository of my artwork. However, as I made more
        and more art, I wanted something a little more serious, navigable, and
        scalable, and as this was around when my time with ORfU came to a close
        and I had just built a website, I decided to build this portfolio on my
        own in Wordpress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, as I expanded the scope of my web development knowledge, I
        decided to delve into the career full-time; after building a simple
        multiplayer game [link to clickbait page], I possessed the HTML, CSS,
        and Javascript knowledge required to rebuild my portfolio from the
        ground up in React, this time focusing on my web design development
        experience (and which would serve as an example of same).
      </p>

      <p>
        I had a clear distinction between professional and personal work, and
        only one domain name to work with, so I set out to create two pages on
        my website: one to showcase my professional work for academic bodies and
        ORfU (and my resume), and one to showcase personal artwork and
        commissions. Each would need to be feature some kind of gallery
        functionality with the ability to look at a picture fullscreen.
      </p>

      <p>
        As this site would need to feature a mix of images, links, and videos, I
        needed a simple way to both store my site&apos;s content and efficiently
        map it out to the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        WordPress, Elementor, Adobe CC for logo/vectors, and the lightest touch
        of copy-pasted Javascript meant to keep an accordion closed on page
        load, ReactJS, Vite, Github Pages, Procreate for
        illustrations/animations, SASS were the technologies used.
      </p>

      <p>
        I went for as simple a design as possible, sketching out a basic
        illustration of the layout I wanted. I didn&apos;t want to over-design
        the site&apos;s layout, so I opted for a simple organizational paradigm,
        and since I feel the urge to expand my toolkit with every project, I
        added constant, but ideally non-distracting page animations with the
        clouds, and opted for a calming color palette. Conversely, for my
        art-focused page, I re-tooled the cloud animation to feature stars, and
        inverted the color palette to a night theme to reflect the more casual
        and dark nature of that commission work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I clearly threw my fears of over-designing out the window. I had just
        finished ClickbAIt, the simple browser game I wrote to teach myself
        reactJS, and my brain couldn&apos;t stop thinking about all the
        possibilities now in front of me now that I could really script a
        webpage. As a lifelong YuGiOh aficionado, I decided on a card game
        framing, where each section of my portfolio is a different card
        represented by a different iteration of my little blue Kuriboh-inspired
        guy. I have never been one to seek out traditional methods, and I
        additionally wanted to feature hand-drawn art to further indicate my
        holistic digital media skillset.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, I pulled together all of the assets I had. Then I organized them
        into distinct “skills”, fit them into columns, and styled it. It was a
        fairly simple and straightforward development process, especially
        considering my then lack of any substantive experience in web
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was another “get it done as fast as possible” project in an effort
        to find gainful employment. I had my idea, ran with it, and did whatever
        I felt I had to to make the “card game” real. I already had the
        materials and copy, so I really just focused on the
        organizational/spatial design, and I wish I&apos;d focused more on the
        planning stage in order to produce a more consistent, snappy final
        result. I also wish I had better considered both mobile and accessible
        design much earlier in the process, rather than driving on ahead with my
        card game idea and planning to just deal with it later. Thank goodness
        for Google.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main challenge here organizational and conceptual rather than
        technological; with one foot in graphic design and one in neophytic web
        development, I wasn&apos;t sure what opportunities were out there for
        someone like me, nor how I should advertise myself for them. I spent a
        long time researching the kinds of jobs available, and after discovering
        the role of Digital Media Specialist, decided to divide my website up by
        skill (graphic design, video editing, and web development) and to go
        from there by project.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first primary challenge was my inexperience thinking
        programmatically and mathematically; trying to figure out where to put
        the “active card,” as well as how to get it there and looking properly
        “3d,” proved to be a days-long challenge for me, and I quite literally
        needed to enlist the help of my PhD partner to teach me how to calculate
        averages in 2D space. Additionally, to fit the whole site on one
        screen/window was a huge challenge, as was re-tooling the site for
        mobile once I was happy with the desktop design (I have since switched
        to a more mobile-first mindset).
      </p>

      <p>
        For both versions of my portfolio, testing included only my looking at
        the site on all the devices I could find and getting my friends and
        family to test it out.
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorite feature of this version of the site is simply the
        animations; my logo bouncing on the loading screen and the clouds are
        parts of my old site I just enjoy watching. Although I&apos;m ultimately
        disappointed in how I feel about this old iteration of the site, I am
        quite proud of the way I was able to get everything on screen and
        working more or less the way it did in my head.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m still proud of this site for sure, as it really cemented that I
        could express my creativity in some way via web design. I was definitely
        frustrated by my lack of control over everything at this point, and my
        work on clickbAIt affirmed that I munch preferred programming my own
        websites. While I&apos;m proud of what I accomplished with v2 of my
        portfolio, I&apos;ve honestly been chomping at the bit to improve it.
